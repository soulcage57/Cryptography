TLS Handshake Explanation:
The TLS handshake is the process by which a client and server establish a secure encrypted
connection before any actual data exchange. When a user connects to an HTTPS website, the client
(usually a browser) sends a “Client Hello” message specifying the supported TLS versions, cipher suites,
and extensions. The server responds with a “Server Hello” message, selecting the TLS version and cipher suite to be used.
The server then sends its digital certificate, which contains the public key and is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
The client verifies the certificate’s authenticity and validity. Once verified, both sides generate a session key using asymmetric
encryption and then switch to symmetric encryption for efficiency. This ensures all subsequent communication remains private and tamper-proof.

MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Protection Mechanisms
TLS protects against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks through authentication, encryption, and integrity mechanisms. The server’s certificate,
signed by a trusted CA, ensures that the client is communicating with the genuine server and not an impersonator. If an attacker tries to
intercept or alter the connection, the certificate verification will fail unless the attacker can produce a valid certificate issued by
a trusted CA. During the handshake, public key cryptography ensures that the encryption keys are securely exchanged without exposure.
Additionally, message authentication codes (MACs) and digital signatures prevent any undetected tampering with the transmitted data.
Together, these mechanisms ensure that even if traffic is intercepted, it cannot be decrypted or modified without detection.


TLS Application in Websites
TLS is the backbone of HTTPS, securing almost all modern web traffic. When a website uses HTTPS, TLS provides confidentiality
(by encrypting data so only the intended recipient can read it), integrity (by preventing tampering with the transmitted data),
and authentication (by verifying the server’s identity via its certificate). For example, when you visit https://example.com,
your browser automatically initiates a TLS handshake, verifies the server’s certificate, and then establishes a secure, encrypted session.
This prevents attackers from reading sensitive information like login credentials, credit card details, or personal data as it travels
across the network. The use of TLS ensures that users can safely interact with websites, perform online transactions, and exchange information
without the risk of eavesdropping or data alteration.
