What happens:
Changing even one character in the file completely changes the resulting HMAC.
Verification using the old HMAC would fail, proving the message was modified.

Why it matters:
HMAC combines hashing with a secret key to ensure both:
Integrity: Detects any data tampering.
Authenticity: Confirms the message came from someone who knows the shared key.
This protects against accidental corruption and malicious changes.
