Diffie-Hellman key exchange is commonly used in many systems that need to create a secure communication channel. One example is the TLS handshake
which happens when you connect to a secure website. It helps the browser and the server agree on a shared secret key so that the data they send
back and forth stays private.
Modern versions like ECDHE make this process faster and more secure. Another good example is secure messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp which
use similar key exchanges to keep conversations encrypted and private.

This method is important because it allows two sides to agree on a secret key without ever sending that key directly. Even if someone is watching
 the network they can’t figure out the shared secret. This helps protect sensitive data and ensures that private messages and connections stay
 safe from attackers.
