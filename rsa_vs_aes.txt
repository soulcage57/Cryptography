Based on hands-on experience with OpenSSL encryption tasks, here are the key differences between RSA and AES cryptography:

RSA (Asymmetric Cryptography):
KEY SIZE: Large keys (2048-4096 bits) for equivalent security
DATA LIMITS: Strict size limitations (max ~245 bytes for 2048-bit RSA)
CPU USAGE: High - uses complex modular exponentiation
SCALABILITY: Poor for large files - encountered "data too large" errors

AES (Symmetric Cryptography):
KEY SIZE: Compact keys (128, 192, or 256 bits)
DATA LIMITS: No practical limits - handles files of any size
CPU USAGE: Low - uses efficient substitution-permutation networks
SCALABILITY: Excellent for large-scale data encryption


USE-CASE DIFFERENCES:

RSA Ideal For:
Key exchange and distribution
Digital signatures and certificates
SSL/TLS handshake establishment
Encrypting small sensitive data (passwords, keys)
Secure initial connection setup

AES Ideal For:
Bulk data encryption (files, documents, databases)
Disk and file system encryption
Real-time communication encryption
SSL/TLS data transmission after handshake
Streaming media encryption
