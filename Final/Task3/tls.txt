      Valid Until: Jan 19 08:33:50 2026 GMT

    Intermediate Certificate (Depth 1):
      Subject: C=US, O=Google Trust Services, CN=GTS CA 1C3
      Issuer: C=US, O=Google Trust Services LLC, CN=GTS Root R4

    Root Certificate (Depth 2):
      Subject: C=US, O=Google Trust Services LLC, CN=GTS Root R4

B. Cipher Suite:
    TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    Key Exchange: X25519 (Elliptic Curve)
    Encryption: AES-256-GCM
    Hash Algorithm: SHA384
    Post-Quantum Security: WLKEM768

C. TLS Version:
    TLS 1.3
    Security Feature: TLS 1.3 forbids renegotiation

2. WIRESHARK CAPTURE ANALYSIS


A. TLS 1.3 Handshake Sequence Observed:

Packet 421: Client Hello (1595 bytes)
 Server Name Indication (SNI): google.com
 TLS Version: 1.3
 Cipher Suites: Including TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 Key Share: X25519 parameters
 Supported Groups: Including WLKEM768

Packet 426: Server Hello + Change Cipher Spec (1466 bytes)
 Selected Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 Key Share parameters
 Change Cipher Spec: Switch to encrypted communication

Packet 431: Application Data (844 bytes) - ENCRYPTED
 Contains: Encrypted Extensions, Certificate, Certificate Verify, Finished
 All subsequent handshake messages are encrypted in TLS 1.3

Packet 433: Change Cipher Spec + Application Data (134 bytes)
 Client acknowledges encryption switch
 Encrypted Finished message

B. Additional Session Observed:
 Second TLS handshake (Packets 2207-2219) shows session resumption
 Similar pattern but likely with session tickets for faster establishment

3. TLS 1.3 HANDSHAKE SIMPLIFICATION

Key Differences from TLS 1.2 Observed:
1. Fewer Round Trips: 1-RTT handshake vs 2-RTT in TLS 1.2
2. Encrypted Handshake: Most handshake data encrypted after Server Hello
3. No Visible Certificate Chain: Certificate exchange happens encrypted
4. Integrated Key Exchange: Key share in initial Client/Server Hello

4. HOW TLS PROVIDES CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY


A. Confidentiality (Demonstrated in Capture):

1. Key Exchange: X25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    Perfect Forward Secrecy: Ephemeral keys for each session
    Observed in Client Hello Key Share extension

2. Symmetric Encryption: AES-256-GCM
    256-bit military-grade encryption
    All application data encrypted after Packet 426
    Confirmed by "Application Data" packets showing encrypted content

3. Early Encryption: 
    Handshake messages after Server Hello are encrypted
    Prevents eavesdropping on certificate chain

B. Integrity (Security Features):

1. Hash Algorithm: SHA-384
    Used in HMAC for message authentication
    Strong cryptographic hashing

2. Authenticated Encryption: AES-GCM Mode
    Provides both confidentiality and integrity
    Built-in authentication tags

3. Digital Signatures:
    Certificate Verify message (encrypted in TLS 1.3)
    Server authentication

4. Finished Messages:
    Verify handshake integrity
    Based on hash of all handshake messages

5. SECURITY FEATURES OBSERVED


 TLS 1.3: Latest protocol with improved security
 Perfect Forward Secrecy: X25519 key exchange
 Strong Cipher: AES-256-GCM with SHA384
 Post-Quantum Ready: WLKEM768 support
 Encrypted Handshake: Certificate exchange hidden
 No Renegotiation: Prevents downgrade attacks
 Session Resumption: Efficient subsequent connections

6. VERIFICATION SUMMARY

 Confidentiality Verified: All application data encrypted
 Integrity Protected: AEAD cipher suite used
 Authentication: Certificate chain validated
 Modern Protocols: TLS 1.3 with strong algorithms
 Forward Secrecy: Ephemeral key exchange demonstrated

The capture clearly shows TLS 1.3's security improvements, particularly the encrypted handshake that protects sensitive information like certificate chains from eavesdropping
